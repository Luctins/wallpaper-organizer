* Wallpaper Organizer
A simple makefile based tool for sorting and formatting images/wallpapers into folder defined categories

** How to Use
Please set the input varibles on the configuration file and remove the .sample before running make.

to sort your wallpapers, create folders into your input folder, each folder defines a new category.

The program generates non conflicting filenames based on the defined categories (e.g. =photo-7k2DbEpw1i.png=) and checks before moving it into your (configured) wallpaper directory.
