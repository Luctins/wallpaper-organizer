* Description
A simple makefile based tool for sorting and formatting images/wallpapers into folder defined categories

* How to Use
Please set the input varibles on the configuration file and remove the =.sample= from the filename before running make.

To sort your wallpapers, create folders into your input folder, each folder defines a new category.

The program generates non conflicting filenames based on the defined categories (e.g. =photo__2024-01-08--18-59-02__7k2DbEpw1i.png=) that sort alphabetically into category then creation date and also checks before moving it into your (configured) wallpaper directory (to avoid overwriting it).
