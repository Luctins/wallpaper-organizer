# Wallpaper Organizer
feel free to contribute and help!

## How to Use
Please set the input varibles on the beggining of the Makefile before running make.
to sort your wallpapers, create folders into your input folder, each folder defines a new category.

The program generates non conflicting filenames based on the defined categories (e.g. `photo-7k2DbEpw1i.png**) and checks before moving it into your wallpaper directory.

## **TODO**
* Add config file instead of editing the script
