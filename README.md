# Wallpaper Organizer
feel free to contribute and help!

## how to Use
Please set the input varibles on the beggining of the Makefile before running make.
to sort your wallpapers, create folders into your input folder, each folder defines a new category.

**TODO**: add extra file for config

The program checks if the defined categories already exists in your wallpaper folder, and gets the greatest number to start counting from (e.g.: it finds `photo-005.png` in your wallpaper directory, and the first file it will create will be named `photo-006.png`.
